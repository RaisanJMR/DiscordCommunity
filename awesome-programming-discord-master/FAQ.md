### What is Discord.com exactly?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)):
> Discord is a proprietary freeware VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities ranging from gamers to education and businesses. Discord specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of 21 July 2019, there are over 250 million users of the software.

Or as I once heard from a critique:
> Discord is just IRC with extra features.

A _server_ in Discord simply refers to the community itself. 

### What about Discord's poor privacy policy?

It has been raised many times about Discord's [awful privacy control](https://swordfishevaluations.com/2019/09/12/privacy-concerns-with-discord/), [being a potentional spyware](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html), [Richar Stallman's blog](https://stallman.org/discord.html), and [risks of online predators](https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-where-teens-rule-and-parents-fear-to-tread-11560245402) in a national newspaper. But as much as I'd like to hate Discord because of this, it is hard to deny the wonderful growing communities that are no less-productive than their counteparts in another privacy-focused platform. That alone encouraged me to create this list.

### Are you or is this project affiliated?

Neither me, or any part of this project is affiliated with Discord in any way. 

### Why is this list made so fancy?

It may seem at first some of the assets are redundant, and that simply invite links would do the job. But no additional objects i.e., badges here come empty handed, they all bring in useful links about a community that would save you some googling.

### How to contribute?

Refer to the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page. As for now the pull request isn't automated.

### How to report any issue with the list?

If you have found a typo or maybe an invite link is invalid, you can open a new issue [here](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-programming-discord/issues), I'll try to fix it soon as possible.

### How to properly attribute to compliment the license (CC BY 4.0)?

I understand [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) isn't the best open-source license, the only restriction is it requires the user to attribute the owner. Simply mentioning the name `awesome-programming-discord` (even without the GitHub link) anywhere in a separate attribution page or on the same page where you used the list is enough and meets the proper validity in my eye.
